# User interface (UI)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(rsconnect)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE, 
  fig.align = "center",
  out.width = "100%"
  )
```

In this section we'll build the user interface of a simple app.

However, before we get into the weeds of building a user interface, let's revisit the anatomy of a Shiny app.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/app-selectinput-scatterplot.png")
```

-   The user interface, that we'll refer to as the "UI" going forward, defines and lays out the inputs of your app where users can make their selections. It also lays out the outputs.

-   The server function, on the other hand, calculates outputs and performs any other calculations needed for the outputs.

### Example

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ui-to-scatterplot.png")
```

For example, if your app features a plot the code for building that plot lives in the server function. But the setup for the user defined inputs for the plot, as well as information on where physically on the app the plot should appear, are defined in the UI.

### 

Here is the app we'll work with in this section and the code that builds the UI of that app.

Since this is too much code to parse, we'll explore individual components of the UI one by one.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/app-selectinput-scatterplot.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/ui-selectinput-scatterplot.png")
```

### `fluidPage()`

At the outermost layer of our UI definition we begin with the `fluidPage()` function.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/fluidPage.png")
```

The `fluidPage()` function creates a fluid page layout consisting of rows and columns. Rows make sure that elements in them appear on the same line. Columns within these rows define how much horizontal space each element should occupy.

Fluid pages scale their components in realtime to fill all available browser width, which means you, the app developer, don't need to worry about defining relative widths for individual app components.

As always, for more information on arguments to this function, you can view the R function help by typing `?fluidPage` in your R console or visiting the function reference page on the package website [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/).

### Layout

Next, we define the layout of our app with `sidebarLayout()`.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/layout.png")
```

Shiny includes a number of options for laying out the components of an application. The default layout, the one we're using in our example app, is a layout with a sidebar, that you can define with the `sidebarLayout()` function.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/layout-app.png")
```

This is a simple layout with a narrow sidebar for inputs and a wider main area for output.

Under the hood, Shiny implements layout features available in Bootstrap 2, which is a popular HTML/CSS framework. However the nice thing about working in Shiny is that no prior experience with Bootstrap is necessary.

To learn more about various layouts, I recommend reviewing the [Application Layout Guide article](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/layout-guide.html) at [shiny.rstudio.com](shiny.rstudio.com).

### Input controls

Next we define our sidebar panel containing input controls.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/input-controls.png")
```

### 

This panel contains two dropdown menus created with the `selectInput()` function.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/input-dropdowns.png")
```

### 

Let's take a look at one of the `selectInput` widgets a little more closely.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/input-closeup.png")
```

1.  The first argument is the `inputId`, which is the input value that the app will internally use to access the value selected by the user.

2.  The second argument is the `label`, which is the display label that the user sees.

3.  The third argument is the list of `choices` the user will choose from. In this app, these are variable names from the movies dataset.

4.  And lastly we specify a default selection from that list with `selected`.

### Main Panel

The final component of our UI is `mainPanel()`.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/main-panel.png")
```

Currently the main panel contains only one component, a plot output. We'll talk about how this plot is built later in the tutorial.

Next, let's practice building an app UI!

### Practice: Extend the UI

We'll start with a simplified version of the app you saw in the previous exercise. In this app a `selectInput()` widget is used to allow the user to select which variables should be plotted on the `x` and `y` axes of the scatterplot.

The `selectInput()` function has the following arguments:

-   an `inputId` that is used to refer to the input parameter when building the scatterplot,
-   a list of `choices` to pick from (which must match variable names in the data frame),
-   and a `selected` choice for when the app first launches.

#### Your turn

Modify the Shiny app code in `app.R` / shown below:

-   In the `ui`:
    -   Add a new `selectInput` widget to color the points by a choice of the following variables: `"title_type"`, `"genre"`, `"mpaa_rating"`, `"critics_rating"`, `"audience_rating"`.
    -   Make the default selection `"mpaa_rating"`.
    -   Use `"z"` as the `inputId`.
    -   `label` can be whatever you like.
-   In the `server`:
    -   Set the color argument in `ggplot()` aesthetic mappings to `input$z`.

      geom_point()
  })
  
  }

# Create a Shiny app object ----------------------------------------------------

### Practice: Extend the UI further

The potential variables the user can select for the `x` and `y` axes and `color` currently appear in the UI of the app the same way that they are spelled in the data frame header. However we might want to label them in a way that is more human readable. We can achieve this using named vectors for the `choices` argument, in the format of `"Human readable label" = "variable_name"`.

#### Your turn

-   Fill in the blanks in the code below with human readable labels for `x` and `y` inputs.
-   Re-create the `selectInput` widget for color, `z`, with options `"title_type"`, `"genre"`, `"mpaa_rating"`, `"critics_rating"`, and `"audience_rating"`, default selection `"mpaa_rating"` just like in the previous exercise, but this time use human readable labels as well.

## Server function

Now that you've had some practice with the UI, it's time to move on to the server function.

Again, before we get into the details, let's remind ourselves of the anatomy of a Shiny app. The basic task of the server function is to define the relationship between inputs and outputs.

### Here again is the app that we are working with in this module

Earlier we saw how to build the UI of this app, and we also noted that each input was tagged with an `inputId` that can be used to refer to them in the server.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/app-selectinput-scatterplot.png")
```

### This is the server function code for this app

Once again there is a lot going on here to parse at once, so in the following sections we take a closer look at the function.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/server.png")
```

### At the outermost layer

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/server-outermost.png")
```

We define our server function which takes two arguments: an `input` and an `output`. Both of these are named lists.

The server function accesses inputs selected by the user to perform computations and specifies how outputs laid out in the UI should be updated.

The server function can take on one more argument, `session`, which is an environment that can be used to access information and functionality relating to the session. However this concept is beyond the scope of this tutorial, so for now we'll stick to server functions that only have input and output arguments.

### `output`

Our simple app had only one output -- a plot. So our server function contains the logic necessary to build this plot.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/output.png")
```

The `renderPlot()` function specifies how the plot output should be updated. Let's take a look at what is happening in the `renderPlot()` function first.

### `renderPlot()`

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/renderplot.png")
```

This is good ol' ggplot2 code! So even if you're new to shiny, if you've previously used ggplot2 for plotting in R, this syntax should look familiar to you.

One aspect of the syntax that might be new, however, is how the x and y variables are defined. They come from the input list that is built in the UI.

### Inputs

Here is the relevant UI and server code.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/inputs-x-y.png")
```

Input x and y come from the `selectInput()` widgets, and map to the `x` and `y` arguments of the plot aesthetics.

### Rules of server functions

There are three rules of building server functions:

1.  Always save objects to display to the named output list, i.e. something of the form `output$xx`, where `xx` is the plot you want to display.

2.  Always build objects to display with one of the `render*()` functions, like we built our plot with `renderPlot()`.

3.  Use input values from the named input list, with `input$xx`.

### Output types

Just like various inputs, Shiny also provides a wide selection of output types each of which works with a render function.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/cheatsheet-outputs.png")
```

For example, in our app we used the `renderPlot()` function to build our reactive plot (we'll get to what I mean by reactive in a second) and laid out the plot with the `plotOutput()` function.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/render-output-pairs.png")
```

Shiny knows to match these two together as they use the same `outputID`, scatterplot.

In the following exercises you'll get a chance to work with other render/output function pairs to add more elements to your app.

### Practice: Matching inputs and outputs

Here is a simple Shiny app. Try entering some text and observe how the text is displayed back to you after a short pause.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
fluidPage(
  textInput(inputId = "custom_text", label = "Input some text here:"),
  strong("Text is shown below:"),
  textOutput(outputId = "user_text")
)
```

\#`{r, context = "server", eval = TRUE} # output$user_text <- renderText({ input$custom_text }) #`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code for this app is given below, with a few pieces missing (indicated with `___`). Each of the blanks are numbered, e.g. (`[1]`, `[2]`, etc.)

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(

  textInput(
    inputId = "custom_text",
    label = "_[1]_"
  ),

  strong("Text is shown below:"),

  _[2]_(outputId = "_[3]_")

)

server <- function(input, output, session){

  output$user_text <- renderText({ input$_[4]_ })

}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

\#`` {r mc-2} #question("Which of the following is false?", #  answer('`[1]` should be `"Input some text here:"`', #         message = "Take a look at the app, what text is #shown to the user above the text input area?"), #  answer('`[2]` should be `textOutput`',  #         message = "Check out the Shiny cheatsheet for pairs #of input and output functions"), #  answer('`[3]` should be `"custom_text"`', correct = TRUE), #  answer('`[4]` should be `"custom_text"`', #         message = "What is the ID of the input that should #be rendered?"), #  allow_retry = TRUE #) # ``

### Reactivity

Let's also briefly discuss reactivity.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/reactivity.png")
```

It's easy to build interactive applications with Shiny, but to get the most out of it, you'll need to understand the reactive programming scheme used by Shiny.

In a nutshell Shiny automatically updates outputs, such as plots, when inputs that go into them change.

### Putting all the pieces together

Before we wrap up this section, I should also mention the last component of each Shiny app, which is a call to the aptly named `shinyApp()` function, which puts the UI and the server pieces together to create a Shiny app object.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/shinyAppfunction.png")
```

Time to put this all into practice!

### Practice: Rules of server functions

Which of the following is not true about server functions?

\#`` {r mc-3} #question("Which of the following is not true about server functions?", #  answer("Server functions should include a call to #`runApp()`", #    correct = TRUE, #    message = "The `runApp()` function can be used in the Console to run a Shiny application, as an alternative to the Run App button in the RStudio IDE." #  ), #  answer("Objects to be displayed should be saved to #`output$`"), #  answer("Reactive objects should be built with `render*()` functions"), #  answer("Input values should be referred to with `input$`"), #  allow_retry = TRUE, #  random_answer_order = TRUE #) # ``

### Practice: Fix it up

Below is the code for the Shiny app we built earlier, however currently the code is broken. Specifically there are errors in the definition of the server function as well as in the `mainPanel` of the UI.

#### Your turn

-   Review the app and identify errors in the code.
    -   Hint: Refer back to the rules of server functions.
-   Do the render functions match the output functions? If not, make the appropriate change and try running the app. Are there any remaining errors?
-   Are the inputs referred to using the correct syntax? If not, make the appropriate change and try running the app. Are there any remaining errors?
-   Are the outputs referred to using the correct names? If not, make the appropriate change and try running the app. Are there any remaining errors?

## Recap

Let's quickly recap what we have learned in this chapter.

### 

Every Shiny app has a webpage that the user visits, and behind this webpage there is a computer that serves this webpage by running R.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recap-1.png")
```

### 

When running your app locally, the computer serving your app is your computer.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recap-2.png")
```

### 

When your app is deployed, the computer serving your app is a web server.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recap-3.png")
```

### 

Each app is comprised of two components, a UI and a server.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recap-4.png")
```

-   The UI is ultimately built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, you as the Shiny developer do not need to know these languages. Shiny lets R users write user interfaces using a simple, familiar-looking API. However there are no limits to customization for advanced users who are familiar with these languages.

-   The server function contains the instructions to map user inputs to outputs.

I often think of the UI as containing syntax specific to Shiny, and the server as containing R code you might already be familiar with -- with some Shiny functions added to achieve reactivity.

### Tip: Change display

In this tutorial you will be developing your apps in RStudio Cloud projects, but once you're done with the tutorial you might consider developing your apps in the RStudio IDE, which has some some handy-dandy functionality for running and viewing your apps.

RStudio will automatically recognize R scripts that contain `ui` and `server` components and that end with a call to the `shinyApp()` function and will make available the Run App button. You can choose to run your app in a new window, or in the viewer pane of your RStudio window.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recap-5.png")
```

### Tip: Close an app

When you are done with an app, you can terminate the session by clicking the red stop button in your viewer pane.

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/recap-6.png")
```

### 

That's all for this module! In the next module we discuss inputs, outputs, and rendering functions in further detail.
